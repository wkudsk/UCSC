This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner:  Alexander Soe (asoe@ucsc.edu)
Partner:  William Kudsk (wkudsk@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Alexander Soe spent       _4__ hours working alone.
William Kudsk spent _4__ hours working alone.
We spent              _12__ hours working together.
Alexander Soe       _5__ hours driving.
William Kudsk spent _7__ hours driving.
