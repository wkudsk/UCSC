The data structure consists of a recursively nested list:
    The top level list consists of a sequence of lines.  Each line is
     pointed at by the car of a cell in the opt level list.
    Each line consists of a line number, an optional label, which is
     always a symbol?, and an optional statement, which is always a
     pair?.  Use null?  to determine whether not something exists.  Do
     not use list?.
    A statement consists of a keyword followed by operands, mostly
     expressions.
    An expression uses prefix notation in standard Scheme format.

A suggested outline and description of some of the functions follows:

 (a) After reading in the program, make one pass over the top level,
     checking for a label in each line.  Each label should be inserted
     into the label hash with a pointer to the top level node (not the
     line).

 (b) Write a function interpret-program takes the top level list as an
     argument and checks to see if there is a statement.
         If there is no statement, call it recursively with the cdr
          of the top level node.
         If there is a statement, look up the keyword in the state-
          ment hash and call interpret-statement, where statement is
          the keyword found in the statement.
         This funcion should return null for a statement that is not
          a control transfer, or for a statement that is a control
          transfer that is not taken.
         If this function returns a null then call interpret-program
          recursively with the cdr, as explained above.
         If this function is a successful control transfer, it should
          return the label to which to transfer, and then interpret-
          program calls itself recursively with the associated line.

 (c) Write separate functions interpret-statement for each one of the
     keyword in the language.

 (d) The function evaluate-expression is called by a statement inter-
     preter.
         It looks up the function in the function table.
         It uses map to call evaluate-expression for each of the ar-
          guments to the function.
         Then use apply to apply the function to the list of results
          obtained.
         Subscripting arrays will require a special case.

 (e) Implementation may use one or two symbol tables:  Functions and
     identifiers may be placed into the same table, or they may be
     separated into two tables.  There is an ambiguity in the notation
     for calling a function and subscripting an array.
