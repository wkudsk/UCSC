Makefile taken from the Cmake directory in the class locker.
intVec.c, intVec.h, and graph02.c all have portions that were taken from the previous homework.
strcmp() was taken from a stackoverflow question and proper use was learned from tutorialspoint's documentation.

Compile the program using the Makefile, when running it make sure to give it an input text file as an argument.
An example run would be:
./dfs03 input.txt

You can also make the graph undirected by passing the flag -U. In order to do that run the program like this:
./dfs03 -U input.txt

The program takes an input text file which should formatted in form:
6
1 3
1 5
1 4
5 4

It will then output to console the adjcency lists:
n = 6
m = 4
1  [4, 5, 3]
2  []
3  []
4  []
5  [4]
6  []

It then prints it in the form of an adjcency matrix:
     1  2  3  4  5  6
   ------------------
1 :  0  0  1  1  1  0
2 :  0  0  0  0  0  0
3 :  0  0  0  0  0  0
4 :  0  0  0  0  0  0
5 :  0  0  0  1  0  0
6 :  0  0  0  0  0  0

It then transposes the matrix, making (a,b) -> (b,a) and prints the adjcency list & matrix for it.
And then it finally transposes that new matrix, making the original matrix, and prints it againrun.

It then prints a set of data points that show the color, discovery and finish time, and the parent if one exists.
The format for the data output:
V   color dTime fTime  parent
1       B     1     8    -1
2       B     9    10    -1
3       B     6     7     1
4       B     2     3     1
5       B     4     5     1
6       B    11    12    -1
