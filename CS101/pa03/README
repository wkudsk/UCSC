"I have read and understood the Academic Misconduct Policy for
    Undergraduates, the related sections 102.01-102.016 and 105.15 of the
    UC Santa Cruz Student Policies and Regulations Handbook,
    and the related sections of the class syllabus."

Makefile taken from the Cmake directory in the class locker.
intVec.c, intVec.h, and graph02.c all have portions that were taken from the previous homework.

Compile the program using the Makefile, when running it make sure to give it an input text file as an argument.
The program takes an input text file which should formatted in form:
6
1 4
5 4
1 3
2 3
3 3
5 6
6 5
4 3
1 2

It will then output to console the adjcency lists:
n = 6
m = 4
1  [4, 5, 3]
2  []
3  []
4  []
5  [4]
6  []

It then prints it in the form of an adjcency matrix:
     1  2  3  4  5  6
   ------------------
1 :  0  0  1  1  1  0
2 :  0  0  0  0  0  0
3 :  0  0  0  0  0  0
4 :  0  0  0  0  0  0
5 :  0  0  0  1  0  0
6 :  0  0  0  0  0  0

It then transposes the matrix, making (a,b) -> (b,a) and prints the adjcency list & matrix for it.
And then it finally transposes that new matrix, making the original matrix, and prints it againrun.
