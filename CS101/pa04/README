The purpose of this program is to apply either Primm's algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm on to a graph to find the 
minimum spanning tree or the single shortest path of the graph.

A proper form of input for this program is:
3
1 2 4.5
2 3 1.5
1 3 2.5
3 2 1.0
where the first number is the number of vertices, and then each line that follows is an edge with a weight.
The Output for the given input above (using primms algorithm on vertex 2) would be:
 Primm's Algorithm starting at vertex 2
 V  fringeWgt  parent  status
 1       2.50       3       t
 2       0.00      -1       t
 3       1.00       2       t

This would be called with the command ./priority04 -P 2 input.txt
Note that for Primm's Algorithm all edges are undirected.

An example of Dijkstra's would look like this:
input.txt:
6
1 2 4.0
1 6 2.0
2 1 1.0
2 3 3.0
2 4 4.0
3 1 6.0
3 2 3.0
3 4 7.0
4 1 6.0
4 5 2.0
5 4 5.0
6 4 2.0
6 5 3.0

command : ./priority04 -D 1 input.txt

output:
 Dijkstra's Algorithm starting at vertex 1
 V  fringeWgt  parent  status
 1       0.00      -1       t
 2       4.00       1       t
 3       7.00       2       t
 4       4.00       6       t
 5       5.00       6       t
 6       2.00       1       t
